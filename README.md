Learning to code 
Hello everyone, my name is Chris I am 30 years young and this is my first real attempt at learning to code. I have always had a desire and intrest in coding but I never had the oppurtunity to fully devote my time. I have a amazing family that is supporting me through this journey and I look foward to learning asmuch as I can.
